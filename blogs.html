                <p>Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an English mathematician,
                    physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") who
                    is widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and most influential scientists of all
                    time. A key figure in the scientific revolution, his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia
                    Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established
                    classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German
                    mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.</p>

                <p>Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the
                    greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he
                    also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p>
